# Employees Shift Schedule

This service is the core **scheduling engine** of the Keep On Time Shifts project.  
It uses **Google OR-Tools** and **FastAPI** to generate optimal employee shift schedules based on preferences, availability, and constraints.

## üöÄ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.11+**
- **FastAPI** ‚Äì lightweight web API
- **Google OR-Tools** ‚Äì constraint programming
- **Pydantic** ‚Äì data validation
- **Uvicorn** ‚Äì ASGI server

---

## Role in the Architecture

This Python service handles **shift optimization logic**.  
It is packaged as a C# Nuget (nupkg), which is accessed through the C# API Gateway,  which forwards employee availability data and returns scheduled results to the frontend.

---

## ‚ú® Features
- **Employee Preferences**: Aiming to satisfy and consider each employee's preferred and undesired shifts.
- **Shift Type Training**: Ensures employees are only assigned to shifts they are trained for,  
to ensure operational efficiency.
- **Fair Distribution of Shifts**: Distributes shifts to employees,  
according to their employment status (part-time or full-time) and priority.
- **Rest Periods**: Enforces rest periods between shifts to meet labor regulations,  
and promote employee well-being.

## üõ† Using This Service as a Standalone Python Script to Generate Shift Schedules

To generate shift schedules using this Python service, you'll need:

- A list of `Shift` objects representing the week's schedule
- A list of `Employee` objects with their preferences

### üë§ Creating Employees with Preferences
```python 
emp_shifts_wants_to_work = ShiftIdPreference(["sunday_morning"]) # str shift ID for simple example,
emp_shifts_prefer_not_to_work = DateTimeRangePreference(now(), 
                                                        now() + timedelta(hours=random.Random()))

emp_preferences = EmployeesShiftsPreferences(shifts_wants_to_work=emp_shifts_wants_to_work, 
                                             shifts_prefer_not_to_work=emp_shifts_prefer_not_to_work)

emp = Employee(shifts_preferences=emp_preferences, 
               shift_types_trained_to_do=[ShiftTypesEnum.EVENING, ShiftTypesEnum.MORNING])
```
### üïí Creating Shifts
```python
shift_start_time = now()
shift_end_time = shift_start_time + timedelta(hours=random.Random())

shift = Shift(shift_id=uuid.uuid4(), shift_type=ShiftTypesEnum.MORNING, 
              start_time=shift_start_time, end_time=shift_end_time)
```
### üß© Generating the Schedule
Once you have your list of employees and shifts, you can generate the schedule:
```python
schedule_solution = create_solutions([emp], [shift]) 
```
This can yield one or more schedules, which you can use as needed.
```python
# Yielding 5 schedules
schedules_options = []
for i in itertools.islice(schedule_solution.yield_schedules(), 5):
    schedules_options.append(i)
```

### üé® Visual Output
For better visibility, you can use the included main.py to:

- Read shift and employee data from files (just replace the files location)
- Generate an HTML file that visually displays the schedule
